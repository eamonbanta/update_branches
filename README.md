update_branches
===============

A script to update a pre-defined list of mercurial repositories to new branch.

To work correctly the repository names should be in the form "reponame"-"reponumber", e.g. repo-6.6

The repositories should also be stored in one root directory.

Usage: update_branches BRANCH_NUMBER ROOT_DIR [FILENAME] [LOG]
